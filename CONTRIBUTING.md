OpenTrack is built by the community, for the community. Add your own events or update existing ones to help the community stay informed.

## How to add an event

1. Create a new directory in `app/data/events/` with a descriptive name (e.g., `2026-vue-conf-amsterdam`).
2. Add an `event.yaml` file with the event metadata.
3. Add a `description.md` file with a detailed description of the event.

## How to add an organizer

1. Create a new directory in `app/data/organizers/` with the organizer's name.
2. Add an `organizer.yaml` (or `info.yaml`) with metadata.
3. Add an `image.png` for the organizer's logo/profile.
4. Add a `description.md` for the organizer's bio/details.
